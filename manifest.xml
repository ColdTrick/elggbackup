<!-- 
Schedules a backup for your the following items:
	- data dir
	- settings.php
	- .htaccess
	- full db (mysqldump)
and 
	- mail a zip
	- upload it to a ftp location

Can also manualy request a backup to be downloaded (button in the admin settings) or tested based on configured settings.

Depends on:
	- cron working! (daily, weekly, monthly)
	- email provider accepting large files and zip files (when using email option)
	- you need to save the settings once!
	- phpmailer plugin (only for backup-to-mail option)

Version History

	- added: backup-to-ftp for remote backup
	- added: button for testing the configured settings
	- added: direct download when doing a manual download from admin settings
0.5
	- first release to the public

Todo:
	- validate emailto as valid email adress
	- admin option for locking the table on mysqldump
	- send errors in mail
	- work with AND without phpmailer
	- backup-to-disk only option (so no email/ftp), with retention
	- secure zipfiles (encryption)
	- restore from zip (no priority)
